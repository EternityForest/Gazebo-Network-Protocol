====== changelog ======
Created Wednesday 06 March 2013


===== Version 0.71.6 =====
Changed pinout to better match traditional rj11 uses, after observing the fact that a pin to pin short is unlikely, 30V is usually safe to touch, and 60V protected trancievers are cheap. Pinout and connector still subject to change after further testing.
Added power supply labeling recomendations.

===== Version 0.7.6 =====
Changed pin ordering, changed unclear wording in that section.
Reason for change: Because power supplies are required to be short circuit proof, a short from pwr to gnd is much better than pwr-data, which might cause overheating in the termination resistors, wheras a pwr-gnd short will simply shutdown the supplies.
Separating data and pwr seems like a good idea.

===== Version 0.6.5 =====
Changed baud rate lists so that no two baud rates are separated by less than a factor of two.
Added support for tuples as a datatype. Added the *fields additional attribute to facillitate naming each field of the data.

===== Version 0.5.5 =====
Changed physical layer.
