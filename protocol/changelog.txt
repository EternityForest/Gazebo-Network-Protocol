====== changelog ======
Created Wednesday 06 March 2013

===== Version 0.7.6 =====
Changed pin ordering, changed unclear wording in that section.
Reason for change: Because power supplies are required to be short circuit proof, a short from pwr to gnd is much better than pwr-data, which might cause overheating in the termination resistors, wheras a pwr-gnd short will simply shutdown the supplies.
Separating data and pwr seems like a good idea.

===== Version 0.6.5 =====
Changed baud rate lists so that no two baud rates are separated by less than a factor of two.
Added support for tuples as a datatype. Added the *fields additional attribute to facillitate naming each field of the data.

===== Version 0.5.5 =====
Changed physical layer.
